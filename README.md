## Overview
IntelliJ plugin to provide code editing tools desired by the Kingsrook development team.

Specifically:
- Single-button to create a flower-box comment.
- Smart-case substitutions (e.g., MyVar myVar s/my/your/ = YourVar yourVar).
- OK-version of auto-generation of getter, setter, and fluent-setter (wither?) methods
- Simple decoder of URIs (e.g., to make abc%26123 into abc&123)
