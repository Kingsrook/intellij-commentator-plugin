## Overview
IntelliJ plugin to provide code editing tools desired by the Kingsrook development team.

Specifically:
- Single-button to create a flower-box comment.

Future plans may include:
- Auto-line-re-wrapping for flower-box comments.
- Class/Method headers.
- Language-aware and/or user-customizable comment-characters
- Smart-case substitutions (e.g., MyVar myVar s/my/your/ = YourVar yourVar).
