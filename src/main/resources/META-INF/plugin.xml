    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The <b>Kingsrook Commentator</b> is a plugin to provide code editing tools desired by the Kingsrook development team.</p>
    <p>Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Single-button to create a flower box comment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Future plans may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Auto-line-re-wrapping for flower box comments.</li>
      <li>Class/Method headers.</li>
      <li>Language-aware and/or user-customizable comment-characters</li>
      <li>Smart-case substitutions (e.g., MyVar myVar s/my/your/ = YourVar yourVar).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <h3>Single-button to create a flower box comment</h3>
    <p>The Kingsrook coding standard requires full Flower Box comments for all inline source documentation.  However,
    these can be quite painful to "draw" by-hand.  As such, the Commentator plugin provides a single button that
    can be pressed (that is, via keyboard shortcut or menu option) to convert one or more lines of text to a properly
    formatted Flower Box comment, like this:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <pre>
      //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
      // This is a beautiful example of a flower box comment! //
      //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In addition, if you edit a comment (adding or removing words, even adding lines), you can reformat your Flower
    Box with the same action.</p>
    <p>To use this action to create (or update) a Flower Box comment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Place your cursor within a line of text that you want to convert into a flower box.  You can have existing
      comment characters already in the line (e.g., it's common to write the line with a leading <code>//</code>, to
      prevent the line from being falsely-flagged as a syntax error).  Alternatively, you can select (portions) of one
      or more lines, if you are making a multi-line comment.</li>
      <li>To trigger the action, just hit its hotkey / keyboard shortcut.  By default, this is <b>F6</b> (but of course you can
      customize that under Preferences, Keymap).</li>
      <li>Alternatively, you can select it from the <b>Code</b> menu:  <b>Create Flower Box Comment</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>Note that, at this time, only <code>/</code> (slash) is supported as a comment character.  Future versions of
    this plugin may include language-specific comment characters, and/or preferences to customize the character used.</i></p>
